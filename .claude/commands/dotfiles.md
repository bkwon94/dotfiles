Commit all changes in the dotfiles repo and push them up.

Read my ~/.zshrc to find my aliases. They are very useful if you want to use them as well.
Otherwise, cd into the dotfiles repo and use regular git commands.

Here are the aliases I use:

To get git status:

```
dots
```

To add all changes:

```
dotaa
```

To commit changes:

```
dotc
```

To push changes:

```
dotp
```

Craft a witty humorous commit message. It must be concise
